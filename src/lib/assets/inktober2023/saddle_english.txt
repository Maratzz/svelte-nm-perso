Do horses in video games have genders?

When they are an end on their own
in a barn
in a stud farm
horses are feminine.

They become catalysts, dreams to hold onto and emulate, imitating as much as subliming
they are the very core of an economy, an environment, and a social landscape.

What bind the women riders in experiencing horses through a screen is first and foremost
love for the animal 
It is also the drive to realise in games what they struggled to achieve in reality, after centuries of equestrian discrimination

It is also the hope of finding something else,
a reality in which podiums and medals are not overwhelmingly distributed to men, despite women being the overwhelming demographics in the field.

The best horses are found in the games for men
men and their wars,
men and their obsession to save the world
men and their refusal to make better horse games full stop,
without excuses,
without make-believes,
without wriggling around to admit that there is a genuine pleasure to be found in playing dressup,

if not on a human, at least on a horse.

In order to receive better horse games one only has to wait until men are in dire need of them, then the industry saddles on and whip it hard to create a realm of possibilities.

Do horses in video games have genders?

When they are a mean to an end,
a tool on a map,
in an inventory,
horses are masculine.

They are a vehicle blueprint, a proto car,
bending space and time,
running across territories to imprint
one's passage,
one's history,
from point A to point B
faster, slower

depending on the motor horsepower,
the gauges,
topspeed,

this one is 3 stars in speed but only 2 in endurance

that one comes immediately upon summoning

Torrent is double-jumpy and combat-ready

features that could be searched on a sport car,
well mounted

testicles shrinking down
or rather 
growing up

for more realism,
more identification
to one's well endowed engine

Purebred,
pure fantasy 
for masculinities dreamed and phantasmed

Horses as standard metre for the size of the map
for our freedom to explore
and to exploit

Horses as companions for our macho adventures
the kind adventures longing for
yet another redemption 
red
and dead.
